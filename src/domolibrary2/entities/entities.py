"""Base entity classes for Domo objects with inheritance hierarchy and lineage support.

This module provides the foundational classes for all Domo entities including datasets,
cards, pages, users, and groups. It implements a hierarchical structure with support
for entity relationships, lineage tracking, and federation.

Classes:
    DomoEntity: Base entity with core functionality
    DomoEntity_w_Lineage: Entity with lineage tracking capabilities
    DomoManager: Base class for entity managers
    DomoSubEntity: Entity that belongs to a parent entity
