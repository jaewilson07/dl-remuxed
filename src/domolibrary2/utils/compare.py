Data Comparison Utilities

This module provides utilities for comparing complex data structures like
dictionaries and lists, with detailed difference reporting.

Functions:
    compare_dicts: Recursively compare two dictionaries and return differences

Example:
    >>> dict1 = {"user": {"name": "John", "age": 30}, "items": [1, 2, 3]}
    >>> dict2 = {"user": {"name": "Jane", "age": 30}, "items": [1, 2]}
    >>> differences = compare_dicts(dict1, dict2)
    >>> for diff in differences:
    ...     print(f"{diff['key']}: {diff['message']}")
"""

def compare_dicts(dict1: Any, dict2: Any, path: str = "") -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """
    Recursively compare two dictionaries (and lists) and return differences.

    This function performs a deep comparison of two data structures, supporting
    nested dictionaries and lists. It returns a detailed list of all differences
    found between the structures.

    Args:
        dict1 (Any): First data structure to compare (typically dict or list)
        dict2 (Any): Second data structure to compare (typically dict or list)
        path (str): Current path in the data structure (used for recursion)

    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, str]]: List of difference dictionaries, each containing:
            - 'key': The path to the difference
            - 'message': Description of the difference

    Example:
        >>> data1 = {
        ...     "user": {"name": "John", "age": 30},
        ...     "active": True,
        ...     "tags": ["admin", "user"]
        ... }
        >>> data2 = {
        ...     "user": {"name": "Jane", "age": 30, "email": "jane@example.com"},
        ...     "tags": ["user"]
        ... }
        >>> differences = compare_dicts(data1, data2)
        >>> for diff in differences:
        ...     print(f"{diff['key']}: {diff['message']}")
        user.name: Value mismatch at 'user.name': John != Jane
        user.email: found in second dict but not in first.
        active: found in first dict but not in second.
        tags[0]: Extra item in first list at 'tags[0]': admin

    Note:
        - Handles nested dictionaries and lists recursively
        - Identifies missing keys in either dictionary
        - Detects value mismatches at any level
        - Reports extra items in lists with their positions
        - Ignores None values when reporting missing keys
