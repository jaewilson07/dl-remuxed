"""
Unified Relationship System for Domo Objects

This module provides a comprehensive relationship framework that models
all types of connections between Domo entities including access control,
group membership, lineage tracking, and certification.

Key Concepts:
1. **Relationships**: Directional connections between entities (A → B)
2. **Relationship Types**: The nature of the connection (access, membership, lineage, etc.)
3. **Entity Types**: What kinds of objects can have relationships (users, groups, datasets, etc.)
4. **Relationship Controllers**: Manage specific types of relationships for objects

Examples of Relationships:
- User HAS_ACCESS_EDITOR → Card
- User IS_MEMBER_OF → Group
- Dataset IS_DERIVED_FROM → Dataset
- Card IS_CERTIFIED_BY → User
- Dataset IS_TAGGED_WITH → Tag
