# Route Function Repair Implementation Plan

## Current Status

After analyzing the route functions, I've identified several categories of issues that need systematic repair:

### 1. Critical Import Issues
- Inconsistent DomoError import patterns (`as de`, `as dmde`, direct imports)
- Missing or incorrect type annotations
- Outdated auth import patterns

### 2. Exception Class Issues
- Wrong base classes (using DomoError instead of RouteError)
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Missing or poor error context

### 3. Function Signature Issues
- Inconsistent parameter ordering
- Missing type hints (especially Optional types)
- Incorrect default parameter patterns

### 4. Structural Issues in user.py
The user.py file has extensive structural problems:
- Complex functions with mixed responsibilities
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Type annotation issues throughout
- Missing proper Optional type usage

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Start with Simple, High-Impact Routes

Instead of tackling the complex user.py immediately, let's start with simpler routes that follow cleaner patterns:

#### 1. **auth.py** ✅ (Already completed)
- Clean, modern implementation
- Serves as template for other routes

#### 2. **account.py** - Next Target
- Simpler structure than user.py
- Clear CRUD patterns
- Good candidate for establishing patterns

#### 3. **card.py** - Quick Win
- Relatively simple structure
- Clear error patterns
- Can be repaired quickly

#### 4. **role.py** - Foundation Dependency
- Needed by user.py
- Simpler than user.py
- Critical for permission system

### Phase 2: Standardize Exception Classes

Create a systematic approach to update exception classes across all routes:

```python
# Standard pattern for all routes:
class {Module}_GET_Error(RouteError):
    """Standard GET error for {module} operations."""
    
class Search{Module}_NotFound(RouteError):
    """Standard search not found error for {module}."""
    
class {Module}_CRUD_Error(RouteError):
    """Standard CRUD error for {module} operations."""
    
class {Module}Sharing_Error(RouteError):
    """Standard sharing error for {module} operations."""
```

### Phase 3: Fix Complex Routes

Save complex routes like user.py for later when we have:
- Established patterns from simpler routes
- Fixed dependency routes (role.py, etc.)
- Created reusable utilities for common patterns

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix account.py first** - It's simpler and will establish good patterns
2. **Create utility functions** for common patterns
3. **Fix role.py** - Needed as dependency
4. **Return to user.py** with established patterns and utilities

This approach will:
- Build momentum with quick wins
- Establish consistent patterns
- Avoid getting stuck on complex files
- Create reusable solutions

## Implementation Strategy for account.py

Let me start with account.py as it has a cleaner structure and will serve as a good pattern for other routes.

### Current Issues in account.py:
1. Import pattern: `from ..client import DomoError as dmde`
2. Function signatures missing Optional types
3. Exception classes need standardization

### Target Pattern:
```python
from typing import Any, List, Optional, Union
import httpx
from ..client.auth import DomoAuth
from ..client.exceptions import RouteError
from ..client import get_data as gd
from ..client import response as rgd
```

This approach focuses on:
- ✅ **Achievable goals** - Fix simpler routes first
- ✅ **Pattern establishment** - Create templates for other routes
- ✅ **Dependency management** - Fix prerequisite routes first
- ✅ **Iterative improvement** - Build on successes
