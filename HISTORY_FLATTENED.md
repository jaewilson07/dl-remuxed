# Git History Flattened

This repository's Git history has been flattened to a single initial commit.

## What was done:
1. Created an orphan branch with no parent commits
2. Committed all files as a single initial commit: "Initial commit - complete repository snapshot"
3. The entire repository history (467 files, 124,982 insertions) is now in one commit

## Commit Details:
- Commit ID: ea4204c
- Message: "Initial commit - complete repository snapshot"
- Files: 467 files changed
- Lines: 124,982 insertions(+)

## Original State:
- Previous history had 2 commits (already partially grafted)
- Tag v2.0.2 existed pointing to the previous state

## Purpose:
To provide a clean starting point for the repository without the historical commit baggage.
