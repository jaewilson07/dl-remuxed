### ✅ Quality Verification

Verified completed refactorings meet standards:

**pdp.py** - Exemplary implementation:
```python
✓ @gd.route_function decorator
✓ return_raw: bool = False parameter
✓ Immediate if return_raw: return res check
✓ Standard error classes (PDP_GET_Error, SearchPDP_NotFound, PDP_CRUD_Error)
✓ Complete docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises
✓ Backward compatibility with legacy classes
```

**codeengine/** - Excellent submodule structure:
```
codeengine/
├── __init__.py        # Exports and imports
├── core.py            # Core functionality
├── crud.py            # CRUD operations
└── exceptions.py      # All error classes
```

### 🎯 Key Findings

**Completed Work:**
- ✅ 10 issues completed (47.6% of project)
- ✅ 5 files split into organized submodules
- ✅ All completions follow standardized patterns
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained throughout

**Remaining Work:**
- 🔴 4 Phase 1 files (simple, quick wins)
- 🔴 9 Phase 2 files (medium complexity)
- 🔴 1 Phase 3 file (dataset.py - CRITICAL)

**Priority Order:**
1. Complete Phase 1 (4 files, 1-2 hours each)
2. Refactor dataset.py (highest impact, 1-2 days)
3. Begin Phase 2 starting with role.py
